We&#38;rsquo;re already in the thick of it, but you can still take steps to &#38;ldquo;recession-proof&#38;rdquo; your career by learning in-demand skills.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this guide, we&#38;rsquo;re getting specific about tech skills that can make you adaptable to a changing economy (and what you can use them to do).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&#62;How Can Tech Skills Recession-Proof Your Career?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;Believe it or not, Skillcrush was actually born out of the Great Recession of the late 2000s. In 2009, our CEO, Adda Birnir, was seven weeks into a new job at a digital agency&#38;hellip;when she was called into a conference room and laid off along with almost a dozen colleagues.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;There I was,&#38;rdquo; Adda says, &#38;ldquo;laid off, with no real job skills to speak of, left staring at a $300 weekly unemployment check and the worst job climate in our nation&#38;rsquo;s history.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But an important detail stuck with Adda. Of the dozen-plus people who lost their job that day, the company&#38;rsquo;s web developers were NOT part of the group&#38;mdash;a fact that inspired Adda to start her career recovery with one small step: she learned to code.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;It wasn&#38;rsquo;t easy.&#38;rdquo; Adda says. &#38;ldquo;But my decision to gain a clear, marketable, technical skill changed everything.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And THAT&#38;rsquo;S why we suggest learning tech skills to &#38;ldquo;recession-proof&#38;rdquo; your career.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BE &#38;ldquo;RECESSION-PROOF&#38;rdquo;?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;I put &#38;ldquo;recession-proof&#38;rdquo; in air quotes because I think it&#38;rsquo;s wishful thinking to believe that you can protect yourself 100% from any possible economic crisis, since there&#38;rsquo;s no way to know exactly how the chips will fall.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Still, there are&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-get-a-job-during-a-crisis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;still jobs available despite the health and economic crisis&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#38;mdash; especially tech and tech adjacent roles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;I spoke with Sarah Petrova, a software engineer at Intel &#38;amp; Co-founder of&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://www.techtestreport.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;Techtestreport&#60;/a&#62;, who said, &#38;ldquo;To be honest, the tech industry hasn&#38;rsquo;t been hit really hard and a lot of tech companies are still actively hiring.&#38;rdquo; It makes sense, considering&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-can-technology-help-us-during-crisis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;tech skills can be so helpful during crisis situations&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Of course, some tech companies will fail in any economic downturn. &#38;ldquo;The best way to find the right job isn&#38;rsquo;t to search an industry, but to look at the companies that are hiring,&#38;rdquo; suggests Steve Cooper, CEO of&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.nextupsolutions.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;NextUp Solutions&#60;/a&#62;. &#38;ldquo;There are growers and shrinkers in every sector, and the growers need tech talent bad.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to the&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;Bureau of Labor Statistics&#60;/a&#62;, &#38;ldquo;Web developer jobs are slated to grow by 15% between 2016 and 2026, a rate the BLS describes as &#38;ldquo;much faster than average.&#38;rdquo; That&#38;rsquo;s an average you want to be on the upside of.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;While there&#38;rsquo;s no way to know for sure what form a crisis or recession will take, a great way to &#38;ldquo;recession-proof&#38;rdquo; your career is by learning adaptable tech skills that are in-demand across industries.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But, if you&#38;rsquo;re new to tech, what skills should you learn?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;start&#34;&#62;What coding skills should you learn if you want to recession-proof your career?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;When someone hears the term &#38;ldquo;tech skills,&#38;rdquo; coding and computer programming are often the first things that come to mind. Knowing how to code is a rock-solid skill foundation for any kind of tech career (and a huge supplement to any career skill set, really). But &#38;ldquo;coding&#38;rdquo; is a pretty nebulous term. There are a lot of coding languages out there, and if you&#38;rsquo;re new tech, where should you even start?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There&#38;rsquo;s no magical coding language that anyone has to start with. Picking a language (any language) and learning it is what matters the most. In the process, you&#38;rsquo;ll learn programming fundamentals. Those foundational concepts will help you better understand the next programming language you pick up (and the next). Learning more will become that much easier, and you can always add more to your repertoire as needed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And, although it might seem like there&#38;rsquo;s an endless catalog of languages to choose from, there&#38;rsquo;s a pretty clearly identifiable group of languages that are best for new learners.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here&#38;rsquo;s a list of coding languages that you absolutely can&#38;rsquo;t go wrong with, what they&#38;rsquo;re used for, and exactly what kinds of jobs and salaries these resiliently recession-proof skills can lead to.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;THE BASICS: HTML, CSS, AND GIT&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;First off, there are a couple of basic tech skills you&#38;rsquo;ll need to know to work as a web developer, no matter what area you specialize in. These are skills you can learn in months or weeks, and they&#38;rsquo;re the place to start if you want to begin coding.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even though these are foundational skills, they&#38;rsquo;re still useful! In fact, you can&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2014/09/22/skillcrushtv-9-jobs-html-css/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;get hired to do projects using just HTML &#38;amp; CSS&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;HTML&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;HTML&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(Hypertext Markup Language) defines the parts of web pages to the web browsers that visit them. HTML determines which part of the page is a header, which is a footer, where paragraphs belong, where images, graphics, and videos are placed, etc. It&#38;rsquo;s a foundational web skill that can be learned in a matter of weeks, and&#38;mdash;when paired with its sister language CSS&#38;mdash;is enough to qualify you for paid freelance work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;CSS&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is HTML&#38;rsquo;s sister language. It&#38;rsquo;s used after the parts of a page are defined and specifies the page&#38;rsquo;s style. Page layouts, colors, and fonts are all selected and implemented through CSS. In other words, if HTML is the foundation of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decorating decisions. Like HTML, CSS is one of the web&#38;rsquo;s most basic skills and can be learned online in weeks.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;GIT &#38;amp; GITHUB&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;Git is a version control system that developers use to manage and store code all in one place. When you know Git, you can also use&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;GitHub&#60;/a&#62;, a web-based repository that allows you to manage files, showcase your projects (which can help you get hired), and work with teams.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;JAVASCRIPT&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;JavaScript is a logical &#38;ldquo;next step&#38;rdquo; after learning HTML and CSS.

JS frameworks not only provide pre-written code (similar to jQuery and React), but they also provide a structure for where your JS code should go, helping projects become more efficiently and uniformly arranged.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Not sure where to start? According to Petrova, &#38;ldquo;If you do not have a lot of time, try to focus on one framework (Angular, Node.js, Vue.js, or React).

Petrova says:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;Unfortunately many really good programmers are a pain to work with. Having solid communication skills and the ability to find your role in a team can go a long way. Many recruiters, myself included, see this soft skill as a deciding factor of whether we hire you or not.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;ve spent months building up your tech skills, it can be easy to forget how important it is to work well with others, not just on your solitary projects.

Tools are always evolving, programming languages are coming in and out of favor, and, most importantly, people&#38;rsquo;s needs are always changing. That means it&#38;rsquo;s standard for developers to learn new skills on the job &#38;mdash; not just as beginners, but throughout their whole careers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Showing that you&#38;rsquo;re willing to learn can help you get hired too. According to Manuel, &#38;ldquo;For me, if a candidate&#38;rsquo;s skills don&#38;rsquo;t exactly match the job description, I will still consider them if they show enthusiasm to learn.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;How do you prove that you&#38;rsquo;re a lifelong learner?

You&#38;rsquo;ve learned everything you&#38;rsquo;re supposed to learn, and you&#38;rsquo;re ready to start using those skills. But what if you&#38;rsquo;re worried that companies and potential clients won&#38;rsquo;t want to hire you without proof that you&#38;rsquo;ve done this before?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You need experience to get experience &#38;hellip; right?

Sometimes (like during a pandemic), working for free might make sense. The trick is distinguishing between times when unpaid work is a good idea and times when it&#38;rsquo;s not.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this article, we&#38;rsquo;ll cover:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul id=&#34;toc&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/should-you-work-for-free/#1&#34;&#62;WHY YOU SHOULD *ALMOST* ALWAYS GET PAID FOR YOUR WORK&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/should-you-work-for-free/#2&#34;&#62;COMMON REASONS PEOPLE WORK FOR FREE (AND WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/should-you-work-for-free/#3&#34;&#62;4 HELPFUL RULES FOR WORKING FOR FREE&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&#62;Why you should (almost) always get paid for your work&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;It can be tempting to offer to do work for free when you&#38;rsquo;re just starting out. It&#38;rsquo;s scary to start asking to get paid for a new skill! And sometimes it can feel like clients are doing YOU a service by letting you work on projects for them, and not the other way around.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That said, we encourage students here at Skillcrush to try to get paid for their work, even when they&#38;rsquo;re just starting out.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;In other words, you shouldn&#38;rsquo;t have to take on a bunch of non-paying clients just to get experience.&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Skillcrush&#38;rsquo;s Director of Operations Caro Griffin, who started her career in tech doing freelance development, says, &#38;ldquo;I advise students to always try to get some money for a project. Everyone should be able to afford to give you $100 for a new website or $25 for a new logo.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Caro, there are three good reasons why you normally shouldn&#38;rsquo;t take unpaid work, even if you&#38;rsquo;re new to the scene.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;1. YOU NEED THE MONEY&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Chances are, at least one of the reasons you learned technical skills was to earn more money. If you&#38;rsquo;re struggling to cover your necessities (rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance), you won&#38;rsquo;t be in any better shape moneywise if you aren&#38;rsquo;t earning anything for your work. So, while it&#38;rsquo;s usually necessary to invest in a career change by taking courses, buying books, etc., sacrificing your finances isn&#38;rsquo;t a sustainable part of the learning process.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It might seem obvious, but it&#38;rsquo;s important. You&#38;rsquo;ve got bills, and if you can&#38;rsquo;t pay them everything else will suffer! Your financial needs are a valid part of the equation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;2. YOU DON&#38;rsquo;T HAVE TIME TO WORK FOR FREE&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re switching careers, of course you&#38;rsquo;ll have to spend time learning the skills you need. But you have to be realistic about how much time you can devote to that. You might be a new parent. Or you&#38;rsquo;re working two (or more!) jobs. Or you just can&#38;rsquo;t squeeze any more into your day without sacrificing your mental or physical health.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That&#38;rsquo;s alright. If taking on work for free means finding time you don&#38;rsquo;t really have, it&#38;rsquo;s probably not worth it, especially since you can find paying gigs even as a beginner.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;3. YOU HAVE VALUABLE SKILLS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Your skills are worth something. You wouldn&#38;rsquo;t expect to work as a cashier, a librarian, an accountant, or a truck driver but not get paid. So why would you accept that as a designer or a developer? Your time, your skills, your experience, and your talent come with a price tag.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If somebody&#38;rsquo;s willing to let you handle their project, you should be compensated for it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;On top of that, the simple fact of charging for your work can mean the client values you and your time more. Caro says, &#38;ldquo;Charging even $100 means the client is way more likely to take the project seriously and prioritize it.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That&#38;rsquo;s important for the success of your current project, but also for those you work on in the future. If you work for free once, your client may recommend you to others &#38;mdash; and they might expect you to work for free again. But, if your client pays you, when they refer you to others, your perceived value will come with you.&#60;br /&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;ON TAKING A NOMINAL FEE&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Long story short, you should get paid for your work. But, if you&#38;rsquo;re a beginner, you may not be able to command the same prices as someone with more experience. And that&#38;rsquo;s okay! Or, maybe you are willing to work for free for personal reasons. You can (and should) still ask for a nominal fee.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It reinforces the value you&#38;rsquo;re providing if you can say, &#38;ldquo;This website would normally cost you $1,500, but I&#38;rsquo;m going to do it for you for $150 since I want to help you out and build my portfolio up.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if a nominal fee doesn&#38;rsquo;t put much money in your pocket, it underscores the value of your time and work, and gets you used to talking about money.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;You&#38;rsquo;ll get a lot of practice and a lot of good will. You can say, &#38;ldquo;Normally a project like this would be in the $1,000 range, but, in this case, I can do it for $200.&#38;rdquo;&#60;br /&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/should-you-work-for-free/#toc&#34;&#62;(back to top)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;2&#34;&#62;When should I consider unpaid work?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;Of course, nothing is black and white. There are exceptions to this rule, like any other.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;A global pandemic, as we all know now, totally changes the game. Maybe you want&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-can-technology-help-us-during-crisis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;to use your tech skills for good&#60;/a&#62;. In that case, it makes sense to use your specific skills to help out with causes you care about.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to Caro, &#38;ldquo;There&#38;rsquo;s definitely a time and a place for the occasional free project, but I think they should be as rare as you can make them.&#38;rdquo; So, how do you decide?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here are a few reasons it could make sense to take unpaid projects.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;YOU&#38;rsquo;LL GET SOMETHING ELSE VALUABLE&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if you love your work, typically your biggest motivator is monetary. You need to pay those bills! But you can also be driven by something that isn&#38;rsquo;t a paycheck, but is still worthwhile to you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Caro says, &#38;ldquo;If you can&#38;rsquo;t get money, get something that&#38;rsquo;s worth money, or something that will lead to money later.&#38;rdquo; That could mean:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;NON-CASH PAYMENTS&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;Non-cash payments can be gift cards, products or services given to you, or even bartering. (You update your neighbor&#38;rsquo;s website, and they mow your lawn this summer.) Whatever it is, you should be able to put a pricetag on it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Caro says, &#38;ldquo;Accepting any form of payment allows you to think through what your onboarding process is for a project &#38;mdash; how to kick it off, when do you bill, etc.&#38;rsquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;When you get paid, with actual money or something else, it changes the stakes in your mind too. &#38;ldquo;Even if you&#38;rsquo;re doing a project for a friend or a family member, take something so that it&#38;rsquo;s a &#38;lsquo;real&#38;rsquo; project. It helps with your imposter syndrome. You&#38;rsquo;re not thinking, &#38;lsquo;Why don&#38;rsquo;t they pay for my projects?&#38;rsquo; &#38;hellip;because you did get paid!&#38;rdquo; Caro says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ðŸ’¡ Keep in mind your cash flow situation when you&#38;rsquo;re offered non-monetary compensation. If you&#38;rsquo;ve been buying $100 of cappuccinos a month, getting them for free for doing a local cafe&#38;rsquo;s digital marketing will make that amount available for you to spend on something else. But, if you weren&#38;rsquo;t a regular customer at the cafe before, those coffees you&#38;rsquo;d be given aren&#38;rsquo;t the same as actual money in your bank account &#38;mdash; they&#38;rsquo;re just extra.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;EXPOSURE&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can also work for the exposure, or publicity for you and your work. The idea is that the exposure will help you earn more down the line.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But look out. You may be asked to work for the exposure, especially by clients and companies with some cach&#38;eacute;, even if it&#38;rsquo;s not a good deal for you. If it doesn&#38;rsquo;t feel worth it to you, don&#38;rsquo;t feel pressured to take unpaid work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re pretty sure that getting exposure through this client will actually lead to real work for you in the future, then make sure to do a few things up front:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;Ask the client to publicly give you credit, by mentioning you by name and linking back to your site.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Ask the client to recommend you directly, through avenues like LinkedIn recommendations, social media promotion, and anywhere else it makes sense.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;ðŸ’¡ Even if exposure isn&#38;rsquo;t what&#38;rsquo;s making the free work you&#38;rsquo;re doing worthwhile, be sure to get permission to put the project in your portfolio.That&#38;rsquo;s the first place most hiring managers or clients will look to learn about you. If the project is confidential, ask if you can send a private link to potential clients or employers when you&#38;rsquo;re looking for jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;CONNECTIONS&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;Your network can be your greatest asset in getting a job, and sometimes doing a project for no pay can help you build that network. A great testimonial you can put on your website could convince your next client to work with you. Just make sure you can see a tangible result and not just a vague promise of growing your network.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;Email intros can be really good, especially if you have specific people in mind. Check their LinkedIn or friend list and see who they might be able to introduce you to or refer you to,&#38;rdquo; Caro says.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;But keep in mind that you may not want word to spread in your network that you&#38;rsquo;ll work for free! It all depends on the scenario.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ðŸ’¡ Human relationships can be tricky. Even if you get along great with a team or a customer loves your work, it&#38;rsquo;s hard to be sure that they can make a useful connection for you or that the connection will pan out.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;SKILLS&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;Working without pay could be something to consider for a chance to try out systems you can&#38;rsquo;t otherwise get access to, or to work on a particular project that you&#38;rsquo;re pretty sure would make the difference when you&#38;rsquo;re applying for jobs later.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Caro has advice here. &#38;ldquo;Some of the things I would ask myself are: &#38;lsquo;Is this project going to look good in my portfolio?&#38;rsquo; Is this going to be the impetus I need to learn a skill that&#38;rsquo;s been on my list for a while or to get better at a skill I feel insecure in?&#38;rsquo;&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Also &#38;mdash; is there NO other way to learn these skills right now through a paid opportunity? (Remember that in technical fields learning on the job is an expectation, not an exception.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ðŸ’¡ The skills you see yourself getting from uncompensated work should be must-haves for your career in the near future. But remember that once you&#38;rsquo;ve done a job or two your skills gap will be smaller, so you don&#38;rsquo;t have to rush (or take unpaid work) to learn *all the things* now.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h4&#62;EXPERIENCE&#60;/h4&#62;&#60;p&#62;Though we usually recommend otherwise, in some scenarios &#38;ldquo;the experience&#38;rdquo; is an okay reason to work for no pay. Sometimes having been on a particular team or having worked on a certain kind of project can make you much more interesting to a hiring manager or potential client.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;ðŸ’¡ The experience you get from free work should be the kind you truly need to take the next step in your career and something you can&#38;rsquo;t get anywhere else. Not sure if it is? Look at the requirements for the kinds of jobs you want to apply for to see what&#38;rsquo;s needed for them. Then assess if there are alternatives for getting that experience (ask professional contacts and mentors if you&#38;rsquo;re unsure).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;YOU CARE ABOUT THE CAUSE&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you have a hobby, an interest, or a belief that means a lot to you, it could be a reason to work for free&#38;hellip;as long as you can put clear parameters around the project. For example: I love catalan line dancing more than just about anything. One of the first projects I did when I started learning HTML and CSS was to build some simple websites for the dance groups I&#38;rsquo;m part of (for free).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Your thing could be creating email newsletters to spread the word about the local animal shelter you volunteer at, or designing a logo for the online fundraiser for your kid&#38;rsquo;s kindergarten.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And you might be more likely to be motivated to work for free for a cause during very hard times, like a recession or war.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;Especially now, during a global pandemic, there are cases to be made for helping struggling businesses or people in your community with the skills that you have,&#38;rdquo; says Caro. &#38;ldquo;If that means taking on a free project and you feel good about it, go for it.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You could work with one of the thousands of charities and nonprofits that need people with&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-can-technology-help-us-during-crisis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;tech skills to help during the COVID-19 crisis&#60;/a&#62;. One great example? Skillcrush student Ruha is contributing to a&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Code-for-All/lockdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;beta version of an app&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;to show the status of government lockdowns and travel restrictions, even though she is new to tech.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Whatever cause you want to support with your tech skills, &#38;ldquo;you should still make sure your financial situation and your schedule will let you take on pro bono work,&#38;ldquo; Caro advises.&#60;br /&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/should-you-work-for-free/#toc&#34;&#62;(back to top)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;3&#34;&#62;4 Rules for Working for Free&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;ve decided to work for free, you&#38;rsquo;ll need to be careful to set yourself up for success. Since people sometimes mistakenly think free work doesn&#38;rsquo;t need to be planned as carefully, they skip these steps &#38;mdash; and end up regretting that later.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;1. YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW YOUR CLIENT&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;In an ideal world, any non-paying client would be someone you already know well. That doesn&#38;rsquo;t mean they have to be your mom or your best friend, but you should know them somehow.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Caro puts it straight, &#38;ldquo;I&#38;rsquo;m never going to recommend doing free work for total strangers unless you have some connection to the person or the cause or the business.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if you&#38;rsquo;re taking unpaid work for the skill-building and experience, it really only makes sense to do so when there&#38;rsquo;s a personal connection. Otherwise, you&#38;rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice by lowering the perceived value of your work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Very early in your career, working for free for a personal connection can feel safer, since they&#38;rsquo;re likely to have your best interests at heart. And family and friends can offer you opportunities to build skills without &#38;ldquo;going public&#38;rdquo; about it. &#38;ldquo;Everyone knows somebody who needs a website, a business card, a resume, a flyer, etc.,&#38;rdquo; says Caro. It&#38;rsquo;s just about being brave enough to offer your services to someone in your circle.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This worked for Skillcrush student Emily.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;I had a friend that needed a portfolio website so I offered my services and got to build a simple HTML/CSS site from scratch. My next project was for a friend that already had a WordPress site, but needed some editing. She&#38;rsquo;s now decided to hire me to create a custom WordPress theme for her. You&#38;rsquo;d be amazed at what great resources your friends are!&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;All of this said, even if you know the client, you should still ask for a nominal fee in most cases, even if it is as low as $20. It&#38;rsquo;s important to set the precedent of taking pay for work.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;2. ALWAYS BE UPFRONT ABOUT YOUR &#38;ldquo;WHY&#38;rdquo;&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Always tell your client what is motivating you besides money.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;I really encourage you, even if you&#38;rsquo;re working for no money, to think about other things you want from this client and to make sure you&#38;rsquo;re upfront about wanting those,&#38;rdquo; says Caro.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That could mean explicitly stating, &#38;ldquo;I&#38;rsquo;m hoping that you&#38;rsquo;ll give me a testimonial, or write me a review on LinkedIn, or have a follow-up meeting with me in three months where we can talk about the results that this delivered,&#38;rdquo; Caro adds.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And you need to be upfront with YOURSELF about taking on unpaid work. You&#38;rsquo;ll feel good about it if &#38;ldquo;you were clear what your boxes were and you know this project checks a lot of the boxes,&#38;rdquo; says Caro.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;3. SET BOUNDARIES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;It&#38;rsquo;s important to set expectations before you start, whether you&#38;rsquo;re getting paid for your work or not. This includes the scope of the project, timeline, deliverables, due dates, the number of reviews, and edits. Talk through each of these before you start so that everyone understands and agrees about the details.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And write down the details. It doesn&#38;rsquo;t have to be a complicated contract, but it&#38;rsquo;s important to have some kind of document. It sets a professional tone for the project and protects both you and the client from any misunderstandings. Lay out everything you agreed on, including anything from the previous section (non-cash payments, exposure, etc) that you should get instead of pay.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;4. SHOW YOUR VALUE&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if you&#38;rsquo;re doing the work for free or a very reduced price, put a monetary value on paper. &#38;ldquo;Invoice clients the full amount so that you get practice scoping and billing for a project,&#38;rdquo; says Caro. &#38;ldquo;Then give a big discount on it, which helps show the client what your work is worth&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;It also makes clients more willing to pay $100 because they realize, &#38;ldquo;She could be charging me $1,500, but she&#38;rsquo;s only charging me $100 &#38;mdash; and this is going to deliver tens of thousands of dollars to my business,&#38;rdquo; Caro says.&#60;br /&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;You can do this (really!)&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re still worried about taking on those first few clients AND asking for money, that&#38;rsquo;s understandable. It can be scary to put yourself out on a limb. But you are 100% capable. And it&#38;rsquo;s a rite of passage that everyone who&#38;rsquo;s new to tech has to go through.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Caro says, &#38;ldquo;That first chance is going to be the hardest to get, but you only need one person to give you a shot.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once you have a few paid projects under your belt, this question will come up less and less. Instead of feeling pressured to work for free, you&#38;rsquo;ll be getting paid for your work. And you&#38;rsquo;ll be able to be choosey about doing pro bono work for causes you care about.&#60;/p&#62;', 1);

', '&#60;p&#62;Since Skillcrush has been a fully remote company from the start, we&#38;rsquo;ve had nearly a decade to test out apps and tools and pick our favorites.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The Skillcrush team has worked from some truly exotic locales (like our Customer Support Specialist Valerie emailing with students from the beautiful Adirondacks or our Graphic Designer Lizu joining a video check-in while literally paragliding over the Italian countryside). But most of us do our day-to-day from our own homes, meaning the pandemic hasn&#38;rsquo;t really changed our work setup.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re new to this, you might be wondering for the first time:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-work-remote/&#34;&#62;How do I work remotely&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and keep up morale without sacrificing (all my) productivity? And what tools do I need to do it right?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Of course, being 100% virtual isn&#38;rsquo;t always a walk in the park&#38;mdash;much less a leisurely soar through southern Europe! Especially if you&#38;rsquo;re now trying to work from home with roommates, a partner, or kids trying to stay productive in the same space. Finding the best technology for working remotely can make all the difference.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this article, we&#38;rsquo;ll share our favorite work from home software for everything from smooth communication to&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-give-remote-presentations-without-feeling-super-awkward/&#34;&#62;seamless presentations&#60;/a&#62;, secure file management to simple documentation, and plenty of others too. Whether you&#38;rsquo;re also experienced with WFH or facing it for the first time, you can make sure you and your team have the tools for telecommuting you need so you never miss a beat or a brick-and-mortar office!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&#62;Tools for team communication&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Why you need a great tool for this:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;No matter where you work, communication is key. Since remote work means you won&#38;rsquo;t pass your coworkers in the hallway and you can&#38;rsquo;t drop by someone&#38;rsquo;s desk for a quick chat, you need to find another way to stay in touch day-to-day.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Why not just email? Well, email can get clunky, especially if you&#38;rsquo;re having a conversation with more than one person. Just a few back-and-forths and mistaken reply-alls and the whole thread has become a mess. An app designed specifically for ongoing conversations with multiple people is absolutely necessary if you&#38;rsquo;re working from home.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Skillcrush favorite:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://slack.com/&#34;&#62;Slack&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(FREE plan available)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Why we like it:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Slack calls itself a &#38;ldquo;collaboration hub&#38;rdquo;, but it&#38;rsquo;s basically a chat platform for teams and individuals. It&#38;rsquo;s one of the most popular team communication tools nowadays, and it also has video calling, file sharing, and integrations with other remote working tools like Google Calendar and Jira. But, at its core, it&#38;rsquo;s a simple way to talk in groups or one-on-one in real time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Here at Skillcrush, Slack lets us ask questions and get answers quickly, work together effectively, and even have some fun.

Developers&#38;mdash;like our own here at Skillcrush and, yep, the students in our courses too&#38;mdash;use Git to create and work with repositories, or folders, of code. GitHub lets them easily view, share, and collaborate on them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The beauty of GitHub (paired with Git) is that it keeps you from accidentally overwriting someone else&#38;rsquo;s (or even your own) work and also makes a history of changes so you can go back to them if you need to. A lifesaver for teams and freelancers too!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png&#34;&#62;&#60;img style=&#34;height: auto; width: 872px;&#34; src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp&#34; sizes=&#34;872px&#34; srcset=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub-768x299.png.webp 768w&#34; alt=&#34;remote work tool github&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;399&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-srcset-webp=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub-768x299.png.webp 768w&#34; data-src-webp=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp&#34; data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub-768x299.png.webp 768w&#34; data-src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GitHub.png.webp&#34; /&#62;&#60;/a&#62;Example of a GitHub repository from our Skillcrush Git &#38;amp; GitHub class&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Other options:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html&#34;&#62;Adobe Creative Cloud&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;software including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/&#34;&#62;Atom&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;text editor (FREE)&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools&#34;&#62;Chrome Dev Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(FREE)&#60;br /&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.figma.com/&#34;&#62;Figma&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;wireframing tool (FREE plan available)&#60;br /&#62;InVision prototyping tool (FREE plan available)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Need to dig deeper?&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Discover&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/99-web-design-resources-free/&#34;&#62;99 free development and design tools&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;for remote teams.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/remote-work-tools/#toc&#34;&#62;(back to top)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;6&#34;&#62;Tools for writing and editing&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Why you need a great tool for this:&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;br /&#62;With all the video and images out there, sometimes it feels like the words aren&#38;rsquo;t relevant any more.

As design consultant Sarah Wohl shared in a&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/free-webinar-ux/&#34;&#62;Skillcrush webinar about UX careers&#60;/a&#62;: &#38;ldquo;User experience design is creative problem solving. So, figuring out who your users are, what their needs are, and then helping to create solutions that address those needs.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So, you&#38;rsquo;ll want to begin by finding out about your users through developing user personas and journey maps and working with design ideation methods such as brainstorming, storyboarding, and mind mapping. Then, as you advance your skills, you&#38;rsquo;ll want to learn about information architecture, which includes understanding website navigation and layout, wireframing, and how to prototype using tools like InVision and Figma. And finally, you&#38;rsquo;ll need to learn how to test your proposed solutions with real live users, analyze the results, and make continuous improvements to the product.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And, if you&#38;rsquo;re wondering about needing to be a programmer to get into UX, don&#38;rsquo;t worry. As Sarah explains, &#38;ldquo;If you code or if you&#38;rsquo;re interested in code, that&#38;rsquo;s awesome. And it&#38;rsquo;ll totally help you. But you do not need to code to do UX design.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;4&#34;&#62;WHAT DO YOU NEED TO START LEARNING UX DESIGN?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;As with most roles in tech,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/21-jobs-in-tech-that-dont-require-a-computer-science-degree/&#34;&#62;you don&#38;rsquo;t need a computer science degree&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;or special experience to get started in UX, as civil engineer turned UX designer Amanda&#38;rsquo;s story proves. In fact, before she started learning UX, she wasn&#38;rsquo;t even sure what field she wanted to go into: &#38;ldquo;I just knew I wanted to do something else with my career. But I didn&#38;rsquo;t know what it was or where to start.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;All you need to start with is to be excited about learning and taking the first steps towards a new career. And, if you&#38;rsquo;re coming from a completely different industry than tech, don&#38;rsquo;t worry&#38;mdash;your background in another area can actually be a huge plus since traits like problem-solving, attention to detail, analytical thinking, and creativity are more than useful in UX, where understanding and empathizing with your users is key.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As Skillcrush Product Designer, Stacey Baldini, says: &#38;ldquo;Being a good listener, having an open mind and never assuming your solutions are right (humility) are important to UX.&#38;rdquo; Add to that your genuine desire to help people and improve their day-to-day, and you&#38;rsquo;re a great fit for UX!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;5&#34;&#62;WHAT ARE IN-PERSON UX DESIGN BOOTCAMPS?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;In-person UX design bootcamps are training programs that are designed to teach tech skills in a relatively short amount of time. They provide face-to-face training, a fixed course plan, and the opportunity to learn with others in real life. Like the name suggests, an in-person bootcamp means attending classes at a certain physical location. So, you can learn from instructors in-person, but you will need to move to or already live in the city where the program is held. Most of the instruction for bootcamps happens at certain times, which can help provide more structure for your learning. Some bootcamps do offer part-time evening/weekend programs, although many require several weeks of daytime classes so you may not be able to have a full-time job or other commitments at the same time. You&#38;rsquo;ll also need to plan to invest from about $4,000 to $15,000 for tuition plus living expenses for most in-person bootcamps, but, they can provide a highly-structured and focused learning experience through the in-person, intense instruction.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;6&#34;&#62;WHAT OTHER OPTIONS EXIST TO LEARN UX DESIGN SKILLS?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides in-person bootcamps, there are three other main ways to learn UX skills. You can teach yourself, but it can be pretty challenging to figure out what to study, to choose the right resources, and to learn without expert support. Or, at the other extreme, you can study UX in a college or university program, but this option requires the biggest investment of time and money. Or you can choose a mentor-led online course, which can be a great option especially in terms of flexibility and price.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;7&#34;&#62;WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AN IN-PERSON BOOTCAMP AND A MENTOR-LED ONLINE COURSE?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Mentor-led online courses, as opposed to in-person bootcamps, offer virtual instruction, customizable learning paths, and the chance to connect with instructors and fellow learners in digital communities and events. Here at Skillcrush, we believe in the flexibility and effectiveness of online courses for learning tech skills. All of our programs, including our&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/user-experience-design-course/&#34;&#62;Skillcrush User Experience Design course&#60;/a&#62;, can be done from anywhere in the world with just a computer (Mac or PC) and an internet connection. And, as with many online courses, you can learn at Skillcrush any time and at any speed you like, whatever fits into your life and your schedule, all at a cost that&#38;rsquo;s significantly less than other options such as in-person UX bootcamps.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;8&#34;&#62;HOW CAN YOU DECIDE WHAT LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS RIGHT FOR YOU?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Given the differences between in-person and online programs, you&#38;rsquo;ll need to think about a few key factors to choose what&#38;rsquo;s best for you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;First, location.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;If being in the same place as your teachers is a must, in-person could suit you while online is perfect if you like to learn in your own space with your instructors and classmates available virtually whenever you need help or support.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Second, flexibility.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;If you&#38;rsquo;re available full-time, bootcamps can be an option, but online courses let you choose the amount of learning you do so you don&#38;rsquo;t have to make any major changes to your life.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Third, finances.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;If you&#38;rsquo;re able to relocate and give up your current job, in-person bootcamps could be an option, but an online course will let you stay where you are, both in your home and your work, and have much more affordable tuition.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;For Amanda, the flexibility of Skillcrush&#38;rsquo;s online courses was key: &#38;ldquo;I had a full-time job and traveled Monday &#38;ndash; Thursday most weeks. I needed to be able to learn from anywhere and at my own pace. I didn&#38;rsquo;t need to add more deadlines to my plate &#38;mdash; I needed the opportunity to explore and learn new skills that I enjoyed. Skillcrush provided me with that.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;9&#34;&#62;WHAT IS LEARNING WITH SKILLCRUSH LIKE?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Besides being flexible and affordable, our courses here at Skillcrush are made to be fun and easy to fit in your schedule. They&#38;rsquo;re made up of everything from bite-sized video lessons and interactive learning challenges to downloadable cheat sheets and design samples.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As Amanda puts it: &#38;ldquo;My favorite part of Skillcrush was how engaging all the lessons were. Opening my computer and logging into the lessons was never a chore. Each lesson built on the previous one and never had too much information at once. I was never bored even though I had technical experience going into it.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;And you won&#38;rsquo;t be learning alone. Skillcrush courses include support from our team of expert instructors via email, live group Q&#38;amp;A sessions, in-lesson feedback, and the exclusive online Skillcrush student community where you can also meet up with other students from around the world to learn, share, network, and even just have some fun together! Like Amanda says: &#38;ldquo;I never felt &#38;lsquo;stuck&#38;rsquo; for too long. There were options along the way of reaching out to the online group, instructor, or seeing the answers and learning that way.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;With Skillcrush, you also take the skills you learn in your course and use them to build real-world projects to fill your digital portfolio. In our User Experience Design course, you do user projects in UX research, information architecture and prototyping, and user testing and iteration plus learn how to show off your skills to potential employers and freelance clients in your portfolio and on your resume. And, at the end of your course, you get a personal UX certification from Skillcrush to verify that you&#38;rsquo;ve completed the program.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;img style=&#34;height: auto; width: 872px;&#34; src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp&#34; sizes=&#34;872px&#34; srcset=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp 713w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-768x1103.png.webp 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe.png.webp 1366w&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;713&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-srcset-webp=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp 713w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-768x1103.png.webp 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe.png.webp 1366w&#34; data-src-webp=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp&#34; data-sizes=&#34;auto&#34; data-srcset=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp 713w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-768x1103.png.webp 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe.png.webp 1366w&#34; data-src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.skillcrush.com/skillcrush/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/L6-digital-wireframe-713x1024.png.webp&#34; /&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;em&#62;A sample wireframe&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;10&#34;&#62;WHAT HAVE SKILLCRUSH STUDENTS DONE AFTER COMPLETING THEIR UX DESIGN COURSES?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Skillcrush students have become everything from part-time freelancers to full-time designers, not to mention improving the skills they need for roles they already have and love or using what they learn to take the next step in their learning journey. Sometimes you know exactly what you&#38;rsquo;re looking for from the start and other times the journey shows you the way.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Amanda&#38;rsquo;s a terrific example of this. She&#38;rsquo;s now a full-time UX Researcher helping design and product teams build more empathy for users. She&#38;rsquo;s also a freelance UX and web designer and is active in the Atlanta UX community, including hosting the UX Hustle Summit, the UX career conference, in 2020.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;ldquo;My original goal in taking Skillcrush was to figure out my next career move. But Skillcrush opened my eyes to freelancing and working for myself as another option&#38;mdash;A world I didn&#38;rsquo;t know much about.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now, I&#38;rsquo;m not only a full-time UX Designer and Researcher, but I also design and build custom websites for women-owned businesses, am hosting a UX career conference, and go to entrepreneurial events throughout the year.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Skillcrush was the first and foundational step in my UX design journey. At the time, I just knew I wanted to do something else with my career. But I didn&#38;rsquo;t know what it was or where to start. Skillcrush helped me learn and explore from one course and then &#38;ldquo;choose my own adventure&#38;rdquo; from there based on my interests. And now I know this is a big part of design thinking &#38;mdash; Testing things out!&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If excited about taking the first steps to your new career and looking for all the benefits of online learning, join us in the&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/user-experience-design-course/&#34;&#62;Skillcrush User Experience Design course&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and start your own adventure in UX!&#60;/p&#62;', 1),
(5, 1, 'The Remote Work Mega Guide ', 1, '2020-05-19', '2020-05-29', 'Everything you need to know about working from home in the age of COVID-19', '&#60;p&#62;With the concerns and uncertainty we&#38;rsquo;re all facing in light of COVID-19, one thing we can be sure about right now is the rise of remote work.&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ankurmodi/2019/12/03/is-remote-working-just-another-fad-or-actually-good-for-your-business/amp/&#34;&#62;According to a recent Forbes article&#60;/a&#62;, remote work has risen 159% since 2007. And that number has skyrocketed in the past few weeks in an effort to reduce the further spread of the novel coronavirus.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In what&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://time.com/5776660/coronavirus-work-from-home/&#34;&#62;the Times is calling the &#38;ldquo;World&#38;rsquo;s Largest Work From Home Experiment,&#38;rdquo;&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;global tech companies like&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/tech/google-work-from-home-coronavirus/index.html&#34;&#62;Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon are all recommending, if not requiring, their employees work from home,&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and other companies around the world are following suit. Not to mention the thousands of small businesses who are now scrambling to figure out how to stay open with their workforce stuck at home.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You may find yourself working remotely for the first time, not knowing the best ways to adjust or stay productive, especially if your whole family (including your kids!) are home with you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Or maybe you&#38;rsquo;re suddenly facing unemployment, and you need to build up job skills that relate to remote work and find a remote position.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a fully remote team here at Skillcrush, we&#38;rsquo;ve had years of experience working with team members spread out all across the globe. So we know how to remain focused and connected as a team, even though we&#38;rsquo;re not physically together in person. (Yes, we do have remote happy hours!)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In addition, as an online tech education company whose bread and butter is teaching our students the tech skills they need in order to get a job they love, we&#38;rsquo;ve also got years of experience training students for remote jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So that&#38;rsquo;s why we created&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;The Remote Work Mega Guide.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In this article, you&#38;rsquo;ll find:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-work-remote/#1&#34;&#62;Resources for transitioning to working from home&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-work-remote/#2&#34;&#62;Tips for finding a remote job, if necessary&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-work-remote/#3&#34;&#62;Tools for developing the remote work skills you need&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-work-remote/#4&#34;&#62;Advice for staying successful and sane through this anxiety-ridden time&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&#62;How to Adjust to Remote Work&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHAT TECH TOOLS DO I NEED TO WORK FROM HOME?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;When it comes to working remotely, the most important thing is to make sure that your team is staying connected.

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the code that lets you put content (like text, photos, and videos) on a web page plus give it structure (like headlines, paragraphs, and footers).

Git and GitHub&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;As either a freelancer developer or a member of a development team, you&#38;rsquo;ll need a way to keep track of your code. That&#38;rsquo;s where version control comes in. Simply put, it&#38;rsquo;s a way to store your work, access changes, and easily collaborate with others.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Git and GitHub are the most popular version control tools nowadays so knowing them will help you manage your own projects or let you seamlessly join a group of developers.

It lets you make your sites dynamic and interactive. So, you can include elements users can engage with, like dynamic menus, interactive maps, and auto-filled forms.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Add in a JavaScript library (collections of pre-written code snippets) like&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/front-end-developer-with-react-js/&#34;&#62;React JS&#60;/a&#62;, and you&#38;rsquo;ll make building sites even quicker and more efficient.

So, instead of competing with every developer or designer (or both!) in&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2020/01/03/career-resolutions-checklist/&#34;&#62;your job search&#60;/a&#62;, you&#38;rsquo;re in a group of just a select few that offer the same skills and services, so your chances of being chosen skyrocket.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As a focused IT pro, you&#38;rsquo;ll easily get to know your area of speciality and the needs of companies and clients in that area. Then you can easily highlight your unique qualifications and experience on your resume and in your portfolio. And any potential employer or client will know right away that you&#38;rsquo;re right for their particular position or project. Gig landed. Cha-ching!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;3. SAVOR YOUR PASSION&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;My personal favorite reason for sticking to a particular specialization is enjoyment. When it comes to work, we tend to put achievement and earnings first, but since you spend most of your life at your job, isn&#38;rsquo;t it worth doing something you actually like? (As someone who only found&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/12/19/find-your-dream-job/&#34;&#62;true job happiness&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;by pursuing her childhood passion for tech after trying two whole other careers, I say &#38;ldquo;Heck, yeah!&#38;rdquo;)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;By going down the path you&#38;rsquo;re most drawn to, you can actually enjoy your work, which I promise will make it seem a lot less like, well, work. And, thanks to the incredible amount of positions available in tech and the solid salary levels in the industry, you can also achieve that dream of yours to finally get paid well for having a good time.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;3 Tech Niches To Choose From&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;h3&#62;1.

It&#38;rsquo;s a pattern of thinking where you believe you don&#38;rsquo;t deserve what you&#38;rsquo;ve achieved. You feel like you&#38;rsquo;ve only been successful because of good luck or because you&#38;rsquo;ve been able to trick people into believing you&#38;rsquo;re more capable than you really are. And, on top of all that, you&#38;rsquo;re sure you&#38;rsquo;re soon to be exposed as a fake by those around you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;These feelings can come up for you in any situation, but the term&#38;mdash;which has been around since the late 70&#38;rsquo;s when researchers Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes found that high-achieving women often&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf&#34;&#62;feel like a fraud and are afraid of being found out&#60;/a&#62;&#38;mdash;is most often used when referring to professional situations. And imposter syndrome has been an especially hot topic lately in discussions around underrepresented groups in STEM fields, like women in tech.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;2&#34;&#62;How do you know if you have imposter syndrome?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;The main symptoms that show you&#38;rsquo;re falling into the trap of shameful feelings include:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;You either over-prepare or procrastinate when you get a new task or project.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You want to be the best compared to others in your office, on your team, or even in your whole profession.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You&#38;rsquo;re a perfectionist and can&#38;rsquo;t tolerate making any mistakes or having any shortcomings.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You&#38;rsquo;re afraid of failing and terrified of not reaching your goals.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You deny that you&#38;rsquo;re skilled, and tend to reject any praise you&#38;rsquo;re given.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;You&#38;rsquo;re afraid of and feel guilty about being successful because you feel like you don&#38;rsquo;t deserve it.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;You might not have all of these symptoms but, with only a few of them, you can still be suffering from this phenomena.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;3&#34;&#62;What causes imposter syndrome?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;Like many mental habits, it&#38;rsquo;s difficult to know where imposter syndrome gets its start. Some psychologists point to it as a trait of certain personality types, while others claim it&#38;rsquo;s connected to upbringing or early life experiences. As an adult, a change in your profession, role, or responsibilities can trigger sudden feelings of inadequacy.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Women are more susceptible to imposter syndrome because society still doesn&#38;rsquo;t depict women in positions of expertise or authority to the same degree as men. And our culture tends to encourage women to internalize failure by blaming themselves for it but to externalize success by writing it off as luck.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;4&#34;&#62;Why is imposter syndrome dangerous?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;Navigating the working world can feel like a battle in the best case but, if you&#38;rsquo;re dealing with imposter syndrome, it can also:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;Cause you to doubt the good work you&#38;rsquo;re doing, making it more time-consuming and stressful to get things done.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Prevent you from doing your job, which can hurt your career, your team, your company, and the world for that matter!&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Convince you to not reach for goals that are both meaningful and attainable.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Keep you from asking for the pay or the position you deserve.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Damage your confidence and lead to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;5&#34;&#62;How can you beat imposter syndrome?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;First and foremost, just becoming more aware about imposter syndrome can help you keep it at bay. But there are also practical steps you can take to&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/09/21/afraid-of-switching-to-career-in-tech/&#34;&#62;stop it from holding you back in your career&#60;/a&#62;:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Talk about your feelings.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;With your peers, your supervisors, and your mentors. Opening up can help, and you&#38;rsquo;re also sure to hear that almost everyone suffers from imposter syndrome at some point in their lives. This can be comforting to know, but you can also work together with colleagues to figure out ways to best support each other, get a realistic assessment of your skills from your manager so you know where you stand and what you need to work toward, or get help building your confidence from a coach or other trained professional.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Write out your history.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;By putting on paper&#38;mdash;or in a digital doc&#38;mdash;the details of your education and skills, you&#38;rsquo;ll realize you have truly worked hard to get to where you are. In other words, it ain&#38;rsquo;t all dumb luck or good timing!&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Keep track of your accomplishments.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;(It wouldn&#38;rsquo;t hurt to add them to your LinkedIn or resume while you&#38;rsquo;re at it!) Like the first tip, seeing what you&#38;rsquo;ve achieved in black and white will remind you that you&#38;rsquo;re successful. But what if, after making your list, you wish it was longer?&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/04/10/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-html/&#34;&#62;Find a project&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;to flex your professional expertise or volunteer to teach some of your skills to teammates (your boss will love you for making everyone smarter!) or people looking to get into your field #payitforward.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Quit comparing yourself to others.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;There will always be someone who is more experienced or knows something you don&#38;rsquo;t. But nobody is the best in everything, and nobody knows everything. So you don&#38;rsquo;t have to either. Focus on your own strengths and don&#38;rsquo;t let what others are doing discourage you.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Figure out your gaps and fill them in.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;Sometimes the nagging feeling that you&#38;rsquo;re not good enough is a sign there&#38;rsquo;s an area where you could be stronger. Instead of letting that feeling spread into all parts of your life,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/01/07/fear-of-career-change/&#34;&#62;focus on what you want to change&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2016/12/12/tech-career-goals/&#34;&#62;make a realistic plan&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;to get help or&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://skillcrush.com/skillcrush-blueprints&#34;&#62;learn more skills&#60;/a&#62;, and go for it!&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Realize there are many ways to success.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;If you don&#38;rsquo;t have the degree or years of experience, that doesn&#38;rsquo;t mean you can&#38;rsquo;t be great at what you do. Even the most qualified&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2017/08/28/how-to-deal-with-imposter-syndrome-in-tech/&#34;&#62;experts struggle with imposter syndrome&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;now and then.

As awesome as you are, you really are &#38;ldquo;only human.&#38;rdquo; So forget the unrealistic ideal of perfectionism and instead embrace the truth that every time something doesn&#38;rsquo;t go right is an opportunity to learn something.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Accept and collect praise.&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;Stop qualifying and downplaying yourself when someone gives you a compliment. Instead, develop the wonderfully graceful habit of simply smiling and saying &#38;ldquo;thank you,&#38;rdquo; and you&#38;rsquo;ll soon find yourself actually hearing the good things people have to say about you instead of fumbling to tell them why they&#38;rsquo;re wrong. And, in case you&#38;rsquo;re still in doubt, start saving emails or notes from meetings where positive things are said about you and your work.

All editors provide the plain text format needed for your code to be interpreted as a website.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our favorite editor, Atom, streamlines your work by letting you customize it with thousands of add-on features, functions, and themes so the tool you use most looks and works exactly the way you want. And, because Atom was built by the same company that created Git and GitHub (more about Git in the next section), you can also access these vital tools directly from Atom.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sublime Text is another much-loved editor known for its GotoAnything feature, which lets you move quickly through your code, multiselect to save keystrokes, and highlight to easily spot similar sections of code. Visual Studio Code, a relatively new but powerful editor, features IntelliSense for smart auto-completion of your code, a built-in debugger for fewer mistakes, and Live Code for working with other developers in the same editor.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://atom.io/&#34;&#62;Atom&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Other Top Code Editors:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/&#34;&#62;Sublime Text&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&#62;Visual Studio Code&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;version&#34;&#62;VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Even if you&#38;rsquo;re&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://resources.skillcrush.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-going-freelance&#34;&#62;freelancing&#60;/a&#62;, but especially if you&#38;rsquo;re part of a team, you need a reliable version control system to keep track of all the changes you make to your code over time. Trust us, at some point you&#38;rsquo;ll need to check or even revert to an earlier version of your code base!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Git is our top choice for version control systems. It&#38;rsquo;s by far the most well-supported and frequently-chosen system nowadays. Skillcrush&#38;rsquo;s very own Git expert Ann explains: &#38;ldquo;Git is a decentralized version control system which allows everyone on your team to work with the same files in the same project simultaneously without worrying that you might be overwriting someone&#38;rsquo;s work. It gives developers more freedom to work whenever and wherever since everyone has a local copy of the code.&#38;rdquo; Just what every developer needs! (Wondering about GitHub? It&#38;rsquo;s a place where you can store your Git files to share and collaborate with other developers &#38;ndash; even better!)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Or, if you&#38;rsquo;re considering working with an enterprise-level company that uses a centralized version control system, you can opt for our runner-up: Apache Subversion. Subversion, often abbreviated to SVN, stores code on one central server, which means it can be simpler to understand than Git but server problems could potentially cause speed and access problems.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&#62;Git&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Another Top Version Control System:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://subversion.apache.org/&#34;&#62;Apache Subversion (SVN)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;boilerplates&#34;&#62;FRONT-END BOILERPLATES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;While each site you create as a front-end developer is unique, you don&#38;rsquo;t have to do all your coding from scratch. Boilerplates are code templates you can use to kick off your development process. These sets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files help you spend less time doing the routine work of setting up your site files while feeling confident that your site follows modern best practices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our number one choice for a front-end boilerplate is the HTML5 Boilerplate. It&#38;rsquo;s the most used template in the front end world and the result of the work of hundreds of developers who continue to update this open-source project that makes it easy to set up websites that are both fast and adaptive to all devices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As you can guess from the name, our other choice, Reset CSS, only includes CSS boilerplate code, which is handy if you only need to set up the styling for your site. But it also ensures that your site looks consistent, regardless of the browser it&#38;rsquo;s viewed with.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://html5boilerplate.com/&#34;&#62;HTML5 Boilerplate&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Another Top Front-End Boilerplate:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/&#34;&#62;Reset CSS&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;assets&#34;&#62;FRONT-END ASSETS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Once you&#38;rsquo;ve made a solid start setting up the code for your site, you&#38;rsquo;ll want to be sure it&#38;rsquo;s savvy-looking too. By selecting some stunning front-end assets like fonts, icons, photos, and graphics, you can transform any site from boring to beautiful.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;There are literally thousands of front-end assets available so there&#38;rsquo;s always something to fit the look and feel of anything you build. We&#38;rsquo;ve found that some of the best assets (like our recommendations) work with multiple screen sizes, so you can make sure your sites are responsive to any screen size&#38;mdash;from mobile phones to desktop monitors&#38;mdash;a must-have skill for top front-end developers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Google Fonts is our favorite front-end asset for the incredible selection it provides for your site typography. And Font Awesome is, well, awesome for the vast array of icons it offers (1,000+ for free and 7,000+ on the paid plan). Similarly, Unsplash boasts more than 800,000 high-resolution stock photos you can use, all at no charge and with no copyright hassles.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://fonts.google.com/&#34;&#62;Google Fonts&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Other Top Front-End Assets:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://fontawesome.com/&#34;&#62;Font Awesome&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://unsplash.com/&#34;&#62;Unsplash&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;frameworks&#34;&#62;FRONT-END FRAMEWORKS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Speaking of looking good, front-end frameworks are another must-have for front-end developers! Front-end frameworks are packages of files for styling and laying out your websites. Frameworks are made up of ready-made navigation menus, buttons, forms, typography, and other assets so you don&#38;rsquo;t have to write all that code yourself.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Front-end frameworks range from full-featured, complex frameworks that save you plenty of time and effort to simple, minimalistic frameworks you can customize to your heart&#38;rsquo;s content. Our favorite, Bootstrap, is the most prominent framework and perfect for responsive websites. It&#38;rsquo;s great for beginners because you can just download the files and include them in your HTML, as well as more advanced developers who can tweak the Bootstrap files to fit their needs exactly.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Others we like include Semantic UI, which features a large selection of themes to choose from, and Tailwind CSS, which lets you create unique designs without, as the company says, &#38;ldquo;any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&#62;Bootstrap&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Other Top Front-End Frameworks:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://semantic-ui.com/&#34;&#62;Semantic UI&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://tailwindcss.com/&#34;&#62;Tailwind CSS&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(Skillcrush developer Will&#38;rsquo;s personal pick!)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;preprocessors&#34;&#62;CSS PREPROCESSORS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;CSS is a style sheet language used for styling your web pages. And you can make creating a beautiful site with CSS even simpler with preprocessors. A CSS preprocessor is basically a language that, after it&#38;rsquo;s processed, gives you even more CSS features. A preprocessor also lets you write code that&#38;rsquo;s easier to read, maintain, and share&#38;mdash;all vital for working on a developer team or even on your own.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We recommend the CSS preprocessor Less because it&#38;rsquo;s great for writing clean and organized code and is easy to set up and learn. Or you can try out Sass, which in some ways is more difficult to learn than Less, yet also more powerful. Both are widely used and have strong communities that keep them well-supported and developed.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;http://lesscss.org/&#34;&#62;Less&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Another Top CSS Preprocessor:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://sass-lang.com/&#34;&#62;Sass&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;libraries&#34;&#62;JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/04/16/javascript-jobs/&#34;&#62;JavaScript is one of the most in-demand skills&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;for front-end developers these days so learning both the fundamentals of the language and how to use its libraries can put you at the top of the list for entry-level front-end developer jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/05/22/javascript-frameworks-vs-libraries/&#34;&#62;JavaScript libraries&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;are collections of code that make your sites interactive, provide better browser support, and add effects like animations, blog post tags, and auto-completing form fields.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re looking for this kind of power for your sites and time-saving for your development work, jQuery is a great choice for a JavaScript library. It&#38;rsquo;s easy to use with other libraries and includes a huge amount of plug-ins you can use to seamlessly incorporate the features and tools you&#38;rsquo;ll be expected to build as a top developer. Or give ReactJS a try if you&#38;rsquo;re looking to quickly build user interfaces (like menus, search bars, and buttons).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://jquery.com/&#34;&#62;jQuery&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Another Top JavaScript Library:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/&#34;&#62;React JS&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;js-frameworks&#34;&#62;JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Like libraries,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/07/30/best-javascript-frameworks-2018/&#34;&#62;JavaScript frameworks&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;can simplify your front-end development workflow. But frameworks differ from libraries in that frameworks provide the overall structure (or framework) for sites using JavaScript, while libraries focus on one or more specific aspects of a site.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Vue.js is the most popular framework nowadays and flexible enough that you can implement it on only certain sections of your sites if you like. Plus, it&#38;rsquo;s easiest to start with if you&#38;rsquo;re just getting into frameworks. AngularJS, on the other hand, has a bit of a learning curve at first but is powerful and popular with companies too.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/&#34;&#62;Vue.js&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;AnotherTop JavaScript Framework:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://angularjs.org/&#34;&#62;AngularJS&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;DEVELOPER TOOLS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;As you build your sites, often you&#38;rsquo;ll want to make modifications and test how they look &#38;ldquo;live&#38;rdquo; in your browser before committing the changes. You can do all this with developer tools, often called dev tools for short.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Dev tools are a function built into modern web browsers that let you see the code behind each section of a site right in the browser with just a few clicks. (Hint: dev tools also let you peek at the code behind any website so they&#38;rsquo;re also a great way to&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/08/23/tips-for-learning-to-code/&#34;&#62;learn a thing or two&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;from other developers.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;We recommend Chrome DevTools because Chrome is the industry leader and DevTools is well organized and easy to use. But it can be worth checking out this feature on different browsers in any case&#38;mdash;you might even find that you&#38;rsquo;re a fan of other developer tools too!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools&#34;&#62;Chrome Dev Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Other Top Developer Tools:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/fi/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector&#34;&#62;Firefox Page Inspector&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide&#34;&#62;Microsoft Edge Developer Tools&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;and&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EnableWebInspector/EnableWebInspector.html&#34;&#62;Safari Web Inspector&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;validators&#34;&#62;CODE VALIDATORS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;When your site is just about ready to launch, there&#38;rsquo;s one last step needed with your code&#38;mdash;you need to make sure it meets current standards and best practices for the industry.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Code validators do all this for you so you&#38;rsquo;ll have the peace of mind knowing that your sites are fast to load, optimized for search engines, and accessible by all kinds of people on all kinds of browsers and devices.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;W3C&#38;rsquo;s Markup Validation Service is provided by the World Wide Web Consortium, the international organization responsible for setting standards for the web, so it&#38;rsquo;s the natural choice for code validation and our top pick. WAVE can also be a convenient choice because it&#38;rsquo;s a browser extension you can use to validate your code in directly in Chrome or Firefox.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendation:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://validator.w3.org/&#34;&#62;W3C Markup Validation Service&#60;/a&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Another Top Code Validator:&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://wave.webaim.org/extension/&#34;&#62;WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3 id=&#34;environments&#34;&#62;ONLINE CODING ENVIRONMENTS&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;A place to try out&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2017/03/20/front-end-developer-skills/&#34;&#62;the most important front-end skills&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;as you&#38;rsquo;re developing them (pun intended!) can really speed up your learning, and online coding environments are a great place for that kind of experimentation.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Coding environments are sites that allow you to write code in an online editor and see the results immediately right next to your code. These platforms are a fast and useful way for developers to experiment and learn from other developers in the same environment.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;CodePen is the most diverse online coding environment in that you can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even try out those libraries and frameworks you were just reading about. Plus it features a strong community where you can share you work and see what others are trying out. Or, if you&#38;rsquo;re focused on JavaScript, JSBin is an online coding environment made especially for that language.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Our Recommendations:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://codepen.io/&#34;&#62;CodePen&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://jsbin.com/&#34;&#62;JSBin&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;So, there you have it&#38;mdash;the critical tools for modern front-end development. Hopefully this list helps you choose the tools that are right for you and, by adding them to your skillset, you&#38;rsquo;ll both stay up-to-date as a developer and take the next big career step you&#38;rsquo;ve been dreaming of!&#60;/p&#62;', 1);

But good news! You don&#38;rsquo;t have to run anywhere. We&#38;rsquo;re here to help, and we&#38;rsquo;re going to start by demystifying one of the most flexible and savvy roles beginners can leverage when breaking into the tech industry&#38;hellip;the web developer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&#62;What is a Web Developer?&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;ve gone down even the shallowest Google rabbit hole regarding tech jobs, you&#38;rsquo;ve seen this title. And if you&#38;rsquo;ve dug just a little further you&#38;rsquo;ve probably also seen titles like &#38;ldquo;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2017/03/20/front-end-developer-skills/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;front end developer&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;rdquo; &#38;ldquo;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2017/03/20/front-end-developer-skills/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;back end developer&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;rdquo; and &#38;ldquo;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/10/11/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;full stack developer&#60;/a&#62;&#38;rdquo; (all without a lot of clarity as to what they actually MEAN).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So what IS a web developer? Are all those other roles related? And how does any of this relate to YOU transitioning to a career in tech? Let&#38;rsquo;s start with the basics.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WEB DEVELOPER: A DEFINITION&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Web developers use coding languages (think HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python) to build websites and web applications.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;It&#38;rsquo;s really as simple as that. Developers take the visions and plans created by&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/01/03/how-to-start-a-web-design-career/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;web&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;designers&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(a separate, but related role) and use code to turn those designs into what you see on your phone, tablet, or computer screen. Since web development is THE cornerstone of all things tech (no websites, no mobile apps, no internet), you can see why this role is in high demand (and how knowing web developer skills will make you infinitely hirable).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Meanwhile, it&#38;rsquo;s precisely that demand that makes web development a flexible entry point for tech newbies. Everyone needs a functional website (from your friend&#38;rsquo;s food truck to Facebook and Google) and that means there&#38;rsquo;s plenty of work to go around for web developers of all skill and experience levels.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can start off with the absolute basics (skills like HTML and CSS) and do paid jobs for friends and family, you can level up your skills with intermediate and advanced languages like JavaScript and Python and work at the highest levels of Big Tech,&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;or&#60;/em&#62;&#38;nbsp;you can land at any point in between. And THAT&#38;rsquo;s the beauty of breaking into tech as a web developer.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sold? Great! But now what? Well, next it&#38;rsquo;s important to note that&#38;mdash;underneath the tent of &#38;ldquo;web development&#38;rdquo;&#38;mdash;there are some specific developer categories. The big three include:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;Front end web developers&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Back and web developers&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Full stack web developers&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re interested in learning more about becoming a web developer you&#38;rsquo;ll need to learn what kind of jobs are associated with each category, what skills they require, and who each of these roles is best suited for. Aaaand, you guessed it, That&#38;rsquo;s exactly what we&#38;rsquo;re covering next.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/tech-101-what-is-a-web-developer/#toc&#34;&#62;(back to top)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;front&#34;&#62;Front End Web Developers&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHAT IS A FRONT END WEB DEVELOPER?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Front end web developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visible parts of websites or mobile apps (think &#38;ldquo;front-facing&#38;rdquo;). These are the menus, pages, and forms you see on a screen through your web browser. And&#38;mdash;while there doesn&#38;rsquo;t need to be anything entry level about front end development in the long term (plenty of developers spend their entire career doing front end web development)&#38;mdash;it is without a doubt THE best starting point for beginning web developers.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Every single website needs a front end, bringing us back to the idea that front end web developers can jump into smaller freelance jobs with basic skills as they build toward more complicated jobs and higher profile clients.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHO SHOULD BE A FRONT END DEVELOPER?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;OK, this one&#38;rsquo;s easy. As we mentioned, front end web development is THE place to start if you&#38;rsquo;re new to tech. So&#38;hellip;pretty much everybody! Why?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Because you can learn the most basic skills needed for front end development&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/04/10/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;in a matter of months&#60;/a&#62;, and then&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2014/09/22/skillcrushtv-9-jobs-html-css/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;leverage those skills into paid work&#60;/a&#62;. But front end development will also give you room to grow. After you learn the basics, there are plenty of additional skills you can add to your repertoire that will make you even more hirable and let you take on bigger and higher paying jobs.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHAT ARE FRONT END WEB DEVELOPER SKILLS?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can read even more about front end web developer skills here, but the most fundamental skills are front end coding languages.

No time like the present to land your own!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/blog/tech-101-what-is-a-web-developer/#toc&#34;&#62;(back to top)&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;div id=&#34;download-box-5ed144c59833f&#34;&#62;&#60;/div&#62;&#60;h2 id=&#34;back&#34;&#62;Back End Web Developers&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHAT IS A BACK END WEB DEVELOPER?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ok, if front end developers build the visible parts of websites and apps, back end web developers do the opposite&#38;mdash;they&#38;rsquo;re responsible for building and maintaining the &#38;ldquo;under the hood&#38;rdquo; infrastructure that allows websites and mobile apps to function. What does that infrastructure look like, you ask? It includes things like:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Databases&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;mdash;applications that store the data websites use for dynamic updates (e.g. when a banking website provides you with real time account information)&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Server scripts&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;mdash;coding instructions that allow a website or app to communicate with and retrieve data from external servers and databases&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;APIs&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;strong&#62;(Application Programming Interfaces)&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;mdash;sets of routines, protocols, and tools that let applications communicate across platforms (when you share an article from a blog to Facebook or Twitter using a &#38;ldquo;share&#38;rdquo; button, it&#38;rsquo;s an API that makes the magic happen).&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;Because the average mom and pop website really only needs to worry about their front end (the back end is usually managed through a hosting service), back end development has fewer opportunities for entry level freelance work. Back end development is generally the domain of programmers working for larger companies.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHO SHOULD BE A BACK END DEVELOPER?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;While there are always exceptions, in most cases it&#38;rsquo;s best to pursue back end development if you&#38;rsquo;ve already been around the tech block a few times. Because of the specialized nature of the work, it&#38;rsquo;s harder to get a foothold when you&#38;rsquo;re just starting to build your skills. That said, once you&#38;rsquo;ve learned the front end basics and you&#38;rsquo;re ready for a new challenge, there&#38;rsquo;s no reason you shouldn&#38;rsquo;t learn some back end skills. A well rounded resume never hurts, and you might find that back end is actually your thing.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHAT ARE BACK END WEB DEVELOPER SKILLS?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Just like front end web development, back end development has its own set of coding languages that make up the core of back end skills. These include:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ul style=&#34;list-style-type: disc;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2012/07/06/python/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Python&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#38;mdash;a popular and easy to use programming language used for back end scripting&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2012/04/11/php/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;&#60;strong&#62;PHP&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#38;mdash;a back end scripting language commonly used for requesting server content&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;strong&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/29/13-ruby-rails/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;Ruby on Rails&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/strong&#62;&#38;mdash;a web framework for the Ruby programming language, allowing it to be used for building back end infrastructure&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2015/01/29/13-ruby-rails/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;&#60;strong&#62;SQL&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;&#38;mdash;an industry standard coding language used for managing databases&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;In addition to these languages, it&#38;rsquo;s important for back end developers to be familiar with REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). These are two examples of what devs like to call &#38;ldquo;API architectures&#38;rdquo;&#38;mdash;in other words, platforms used for building and managing APIs. You can read a whoooole lot more about these two Platforms in&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/soap-vs-rest-comparing-two-apis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;this Upwork article&#60;/a&#62;, but the takeaway here is that you&#38;rsquo;ll need to familiarize yourself with them if you decide to get really serious about back end web development.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;BACK END DEVELOPER JOBS AND SALARIES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;As you might guess, back end web development&#38;rsquo;s steeper learning curve and higher barrier to entry also means the jobs pay a bit more than what you&#38;rsquo;ll see with front end developer roles.

Due to being versed in both sides of the development process, full stack developers can theoretically contribute anywhere as needed on a development team. In fact, some big tech companies like Facebook have a reputation for actively seeking out full stack developers with the idea that they make for the most versatile job candidates (the term &#38;ldquo;full stack developer&#38;rdquo; was canonized in a 2010 post by Facebook engineer Carlos Bueno).&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHO SHOULD BE A FULL STACK DEVELOPER?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Sooo, does the above mean that full stack web development should be the ultimate aim of all web developers? Eh, not really. If you DO want to work for a major tech company like Facebook, then sure, fleshing out as many front end AND back end skills as you can is one of the most direct ways to get there. But the great thing about tech is that it&#38;rsquo;s not one size fits all. If you want to work in big tech then by all means, follow your dream, but if you want the flexibility that comes with doing freelance front end work, that option is all yours, too. It&#38;rsquo;s completely up to what kind of work appeals to YOU.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER JOBS AND SALARIES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Right now, Indeed lists nearly 16,000 open full stack web developer jobs at&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Full-Stack-Developer-Salaries&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;an average of $109,728 per year&#60;/a&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;', 1);

Is changing careers one of your New Yearâ€™s resolutions but youâ€™re not quite sure how to get started?', '&#60;p&#62;Feeling stuck in a job or career you hate is not a promising way to start a new year&#38;mdash;especially a new decade! But the good news is that you&#38;rsquo;ve already taken the first step toward a new career: awareness that you want one. So allow me to help with the next step: doing something about it!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Read on, and you&#38;rsquo;ll learn five steps that will get you on the right path to your dream career.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;1. Determine the New Career That&#38;rsquo;s Right for You&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;The first step to making a career change may be one of the most difficult. Many people know they&#38;rsquo;re unhappy with their job and want to find a new career, but aren&#38;rsquo;t exactly sure what position is right for them.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you already happen to have your sights set on a specific role, congrats! You can skip this step. But if you&#38;rsquo;re still trying to home in on what your new career will be, start with some introspection.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;As career coach and keynote speaker Ashley Stahl says in&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2018/09/27/5-steps-to-finding-the-right-career-for-you/#4f426625abbb&#34;&#62;this Forbes article&#60;/a&#62;, &#38;ldquo;Rather than looking at job titles, consider your interests, hobbies, and skills, and then work out how those translate.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Ask yourself questions like:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;What are my strengths?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What are my values?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What are my interests outside of work?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What accomplishments am I most proud of?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Which responsibilities at my current job motivate and inspire me?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Which responsibilities do I dread?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What do I like most about the culture of my current industry?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What do I wish I could change about the culture of my current industry?&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;What type of environment do I want to work in? (In an office with spirited coworkers? In the privacy of my own home? For a company that offers flexible hours and location independence?)&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;&#60;p&#62;Now do some research and make a list of career options that align with your answers to the above questions. It&#38;rsquo;s all about finding the overlap.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Doing this work will help you uncover not only the type of job you&#38;rsquo;d like to have but also the type of company (and&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/11/20/remote-work-company-culture/&#34;&#62;company culture&#60;/a&#62;) you&#38;rsquo;d like to be part of. Maybe a mission-driven company feels most inspiring to you. Or one that focuses on transparency. Or on a remote team that hosts virtual baby showers to celebrate with each other from afar. (Yes, our team at Skillcrush definitely does this!)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;2. Put Yourself Out There&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;Although introspection is an important piece of the how-to-change-careers puzzle, it&#38;rsquo;s not the only piece. To truly understand which new career is right for you, you need to get some firsthand experience.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;So put yourself out there! Yes, even before you&#38;rsquo;re ready! Go to&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/05/09/networking-tips-for-introverts-in-a-new-industry/&#34;&#62;networking events&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;in the new field you&#38;rsquo;re interested in. Schedule an informational interview or shadow someone who has a job that interests you.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;This type of firsthand experience is incredibly valuable. Even if a job looks like it could be a good fit from a job description, the day-to-day tasks may not be what you bargained for.&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2018/09/27/5-steps-to-finding-the-right-career-for-you/#13ed712f5abb&#34;&#62;As Stahl says&#60;/a&#62;, &#38;ldquo;The more people you meet, the more insight you can get into what the work environment is like, what the people are like, and how they enjoy the work.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;The sooner you get a clear picture of&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/08/13/what-do-ux-designers-do/&#34;&#62;the day in the life of a UX designer&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;or a&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/03/20/what-does-a-wordpress-developer-do/&#34;&#62;WordPress developer&#60;/a&#62;, or whatever position you&#38;rsquo;re interested in, the better!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;3. Get the Skills You Need&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;The next step for changing careers is identifying your skill gaps and working to fill them. You can research job postings to see what skills hiring managers value or (even better!) ask which skills are most in-demand during an informational interview.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;If you&#38;rsquo;re interested in a tech career, you may need to improve your tech skills. But if you&#38;rsquo;re still not quite sure which tech career you want to pursue, that&#38;rsquo;s 100% ok! As you start taking classes, you&#38;rsquo;ll better understand where your interests lie.

You have skills you&#38;rsquo;ve gained from your current or previous positions, skills that are completely transferable. And these are skills that employers are looking for!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;According to&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/02/09/the-7-transferable-skills-to-help-you-change-careers/#2cc35b7f4c04&#34;&#62;this Forbes article&#60;/a&#62;, the top seven transferable skills include:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal;&#34;&#62;&#60;li&#62;Technical&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Communication&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Critical thinking&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Multitasking&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Teamwork&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Creativity&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Leadership&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ol&#62;&#60;p&#62;Already have some of these under your belt (I bet you do!)? Then you&#38;rsquo;re already that much closer to your dream career!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;4. Dispel Doubts&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;When it comes to changing careers&#38;mdash;or making any big change for that matter&#38;mdash;you may start to doubt yourself. Whether you&#38;rsquo;re facing&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/12/12/what-is-imposter-syndrome/&#34;&#62;imposter syndrome&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;or feeling&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/01/07/fear-of-career-change/&#34;&#62;scared of change&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;in general, going after a new career takes a boatload of courage. But knowing you&#38;rsquo;re not alone on your journey can help!&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;You can&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2013/06/07/dont-have-a-mentor-you-may-be-making-these-simple-and-fixable-mistakes/&#34;&#62;find a mentor&#60;/a&#62;,&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2019/12/30/how-to-find-tech-meetups/&#34;&#62;attend tech meetups&#60;/a&#62;, or develop a support network of others who are also making a career change. Together, you can learn from losses and (most definitely!) celebrate wins.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;5. Accept That There&#38;rsquo;s No Straight Path to Changing Careers&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;No matter what, the most important thing to remember is that changing careers takes time, and it&#38;rsquo;s not always a straight path.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;In&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/podcast/2018/04/career-transitions&#34;&#62;an episode of the Dear HBR advice podcast&#60;/a&#62;, Whitney Johnson, author of&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;Disrupt Yourself: Putting the Power of Disruptive Innovation to Work&#60;/em&#62;, puts career transition into perspective. She says, &#38;ldquo;I think the biggest misconception is that when we look back on it, it looks very, very linear&#38;hellip; And I think it&#38;rsquo;s rare that when we&#38;rsquo;re making a transition that we&#38;rsquo;re able to just go from step to step to step. Almost always there&#38;rsquo;s a step back in order to slingshot forward.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Knowing there will be twists and turns along the road to your new job will help you take them all in stride, and changing careers will become significantly easier.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Whatever career change you&#38;rsquo;re making, focus on the above five steps to help you smooth out the transition process. Soon you can turn all of your career change fears into a dream career reality!&#60;/p&#62;', 1);

This term speaks to the assumption that jobs are either done in a traditional office or from your living room (and you&#38;rsquo;ll see that there are plenty of other options in between), but&#38;mdash;for many people&#38;mdash;working out of their house is a perfect remote solution.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Telecommuting jobs typically allow people to work from their home (or elsewhere) for companies or organizations that are still in their immediate area. A job where someone works in an office three days a week, but spends two days working from home is a classic example of telecommuting.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Remote work is a catch-all term that applies to work that can be done from anywhere in the world (assuming the location has access to electricity, internet access, etc). Since work from home jobs and telecommuting jobs are subsets of remote work, we prefer to use remote work to describe any job that doesn&#38;rsquo;t involve being tied to a specific office or workplace. If you&#38;rsquo;re working from home, that&#38;rsquo;s remote work, but if you&#38;rsquo;re working from a coworking space, a coffee shop, or the beach, that&#38;rsquo;s remote work, too.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;p&#62;Keep in mind that, after the pandemic sent us all home in 2020, these distinctions have become less relevant! That said, it&#38;rsquo;s important to understand the lingo when diving into the job search.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;(Again, if you want the full explanation, you can read&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/2018/11/07/what-is-remote-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;our article answering &#38;ldquo;What is Remote Work?&#38;rdquo; here&#60;/a&#62;.)&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/24-percent-of-employed-people-did-some-or-all-of-their-work-at-home-in-2015.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics&#60;/a&#62;, the number of people doing some or all of their work remotely was on the rise even before 2020, so there&#38;rsquo;s no time like the present to get in on the unique benefits and advantages a remote position has to offer.

The site was started by two tech-savvy moms who were dedicate to making other women&#38;rsquo;s digital nomad dreams a reality, and PowerToFly continues that mission today.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h3&#62;17.&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://landing.jobs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;LANDING.JOBS&#60;/a&#62;&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;While&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://landing.jobs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#62;Landing Jobs&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;doesn&#38;rsquo;t have a huge section of their tech job opportunities dedicated to working remotely, they do carefully curate their listings.

What are their career goals? What does diversity and inclusion mean to them? What barriers have they experienced in the tech world and how can we help?&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;a href=&#34;https://skillcrush.com/diversity-in-tech-report-live&#34;&#62;Their answers were surprising.&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;They were upsetting.

As&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/245062/whats-the-difference-between-javascript-and-java&#34;&#62;one Quora user&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;puts it:&#60;/p&#62;&#60;blockquote&#62;&#60;p&#62;Javascript and Java &#38;ldquo;are similar like the words &#38;lsquo;car&#38;rsquo; and &#38;lsquo;carpet&#38;rsquo; are similar.&#38;rdquo;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;/blockquote&#62;&#60;h3&#62;WHY ARE THE NAMES SO SIMILAR THEN?&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;The overlap (and resulting confusion) is intentional.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Java, created in 1990 by James A. Gosling, a computer scientist at Sun Microsystems, was already plenty popular by the time Netscape named its programming language JavaScript in late 1995.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Piggybacking off Java&#38;rsquo;s popularity was as smart business move. As another Quora user theorizes, Netscape wanted &#38;ldquo;to confuse the unwary into thinking it had something to do with Java, the buzzword of the day&#38;mdash;and it succeeded.&#38;rdquo;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;That explanation is a bit extreme and not totally accurate. The reality is that JavaScript, designed by Brendan Eich of Netscape, was initially called LiveScript, but&#38;nbsp;&#60;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html&#34; aria-invalid=&#34;true&#34;&#62;a marketing agreement&#60;/a&#62;&#38;nbsp;(dare we call it a ploy?) between Netscape and Sun led Netscape to rename it JavaScript for co-branding purposes. At the time, Sun had agreed to let Netscape bundle its (then) leading browser with Java runtime. The name change was part of the deal.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;Since then, Java has arguably faded in popularity&#38;mdash;but JavaScript has decidedly&#38;hellip;not. You could say that JavaScript owes its rise to Java&#38;rsquo;s name appeal. Not everyone would agree, I&#38;rsquo;m guessing. But the main takeaway is this: Beyond naming convention, the two languages have little to nothing in common.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;h2&#62;Java versus JavaScript: A Quick Comparison&#60;/h2&#62;&#60;p&#62;OK, but let&#38;rsquo;s say you want a little more detail on the differences between the two.

JavaScript is dynamic.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;Java is a standalone language&#38;mdash;it likes its freedom. JavaScript is a little more emotionally co-dependent (but in a good way?), meaning that it works&#38;nbsp;&#60;em&#62;with&#60;/em&#62;&#38;nbsp;HTML and CSS on web pages to create dynamic content.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/li&#62;&#60;li&#62;In 2019, JavaScript is a must-learn for web developers because it&#38;rsquo;s used pretty much any and everywhere, whereas Java is largely considered&#60;a href=&#34;https://www.freelancinggig.com/blog/2018/08/29/what-big-companies-still-code-in-java-do-major-corporations-still-use-java/&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;a &#38;ldquo;previous generation programming language&#38;rdquo;&#60;/a&#62;, though certainly plenty of sites still use it.&#60;/li&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;&#60;h3&#62;SIMILARITIES&#60;/h3&#62;&#60;p&#62;Like we said, there aren&#38;rsquo;t many.

We were assigned the task on Wednesday evening and by Friday we had completed our first sprint planning meeting and designed and created the database. Before our initial sprint planning meeting we created a shared Google Drive so that we could jot down our ideas. We researched lots of different blogs to see what kind of functionality they had and compiled the features that we wanted to include in our blog. We also had a section for guides and cheat sheets for things like MYSQL and GitHub that we could refer to if we were stuck. Early on, we worked hard to create a working culture where we could share ideas and be comfortable with giving and receiving constructive feedback. We got started the very next day and spent the whole weekend working on our blog together. We decided to split up and pair programme, taking turns to drive and navigate which was an invaluable experience.&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&#62;Our initial excitement about the project initially pushed us as a team, we had a lot of fun planning and coming with ideas for things that we could include on our blog. As such we didn&#38;rsquo;t have any issues in terms of staying motivated as we were all up for the challenge and were determined to achieve the best result possible. Frequent contact and group meetings ensured that we were always up to date on what was going on. I don&#38;rsquo;t think we have actually had a day off in the last 3 weeks so it has been pretty intense, however we all brought a lot of passion to succeed so this kept us balanced.&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&#62;Additional features&#38;nbsp;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/p&#62;&#60;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&#62;There were many features that we would have liked to have added but we did run out of time unfortunately.
